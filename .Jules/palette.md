## 2024-05-23 - Admin Login Accessibility Improvements
**Learning:** Adding a password visibility toggle significantly improves usability, but requires careful accessibility implementation (ARIA labels, keyboard focus). Also, ensuring all inputs have associated labels via `htmlFor` and `id` is critical for screen readers.
**Action:** When implementing form fields, always include `htmlFor` and `id`. For password fields, consider adding a toggle by default.

## 2024-05-24 - Toast Notification Accessibility
**Learning:** Toast notifications often lack ARIA roles (`role="status"`) and dismiss buttons, making them inaccessible to screen readers and frustrating for users who want to clear them. Adding `pointer-events-none` to the container and `pointer-events-auto` to the toasts allows users to click elements behind the empty space of the toast container.
**Action:** Always include `role="status"` or `role="alert"` for toasts, ensure they are dismissible via keyboard, and manage pointer events to avoid blocking UI.

## 2025-05-26 - Loading State Accessibility
**Learning:** A simple spinning div is invisible to screen readers. They need explicit `role="status"` and visually hidden text (e.g., via `sr-only` class) to know the application is working.
**Action:** Always wrap loading spinners in a container with `role="status"` and include descriptive text for screen readers.
